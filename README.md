# Personal Website Backend Repository

## What is it ?
It's the backend of my react website, an API simple API that will retrieve yn MySQL DB data for the website

## Technology used
NestJS just that :D

## Docs
If you want to use it for your own purpose, all doc can be retrieved by typing http://localhost:3000/api-doc (port will be configurable later)

No auth currently or else, but will be implemented later because this backend is not currently connected to the website (just in dev in local environment)
